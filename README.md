ODIN Sign-Up Form


A visually polished, assignment-driven sign-up form built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This project demonstrates mastery of HTML and CSS fundamentals, including layout, typography, form validation, and semantic structure.


Project Overview


This form replicates a professional sign-up experience, featuring:
- A full-height background image with a semi-transparent logo overlay
- A clean, two-column layout using Flexbox
- Custom font integration (NorseBold) for branding
- Structured form fields with grouped inputs and labels
- Interactive styling for focus and validation states
- A call-to-action button styled to match the image palette

Features
- Responsive Layout (desktop-focused)
- Custom Font Loading via @font-face
- Input Focus Styling with blue borders and subtle shadows
- Validation Feedback using :invalid and :focus pseudo-classes
- Character Limits enforced via minlength and maxlength
- Semantic HTML for accessibility and clarity
- Visual Hierarchy through spacing, font sizing, and grouping
